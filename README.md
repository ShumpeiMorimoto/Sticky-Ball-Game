# Sticky-Ball-Game

This game idea is from a Japanese game called "Katamari Damacy," and I will implement this game. The goal of this game is to create a big sphere as possible in a limited time. You roll a ball and stick an object that is generated through the field. You can stick any object in the field, but you have to make the ball bigger to stick a large object.

You can play the Sticky Ball game on https://shumpeimorimoto.github.io/unitygame/ You will need an xbox controller to play the game.
